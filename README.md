#QuickGraph for Android

This is an android webview wrapper for the QuickGrapher web app. It implements a local copy of the code, with something that (hopefully) renders correctly on the phone's screen. Landscape is forced because I'm sick of looking at css this evening. Below is the QuickGrapher README. GuickGrapher git - https://github.com/huntergdavis/Quick-Grapher

QuickGrapher.com was one of the research projects spun out of Discursive Labs.   One of the most promising projects we worked on, it always felt like a project without an intended audience, but it never really lifted off.  I'm quite proud of the work that Mark and I did, and think it's a tremendously cool project.  

You can use it to embed graphs of any equation within a webpage as easily as a single tag.  You can use it to solve complex equations, functions, etc.  It runs completely in client side Javascript and doesn't require a web connection. it runs on mobile and desktop platforms.  It can display hundreds of thousands of data points and adjust them in real-time.  And now it's open source, BSD licensed, and ready for you to use to escape the tyrannical grasp of Wolfram Alpha.

I wrote this one in about an hour and a half. But, only the android portion. All other work was done by huntergdavis
